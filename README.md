# discord-bot-gamesoc
This is currently me experimenting and learning how to create a custom bot for the Newcastle University Gaming Society Discord. The code is *very messy* so please only take this with a pinch of salt. I would not recommend copying large chunks of this code for this reason.

This will eventually become my dissertation project in September 2018 (hopefully), after which this repository will be cleared and I will start from fresh.

This bot was created using these libraries (which I will also likely be using when I redo this project):
- Javacord - https://github.com/BtoBastian/Javacord
- Twitch4J - https://github.com/twitch4j/twitch4j
- Twitter4J - https://github.com/yusuke/twitter4j/
